<h2 style="clear:both; padding-top:2em;">SIGMOD Best Paper Award</h2><p><strong>Interventional Fairness : Causal Database Repair for Algorithmic Fairness</strong>
</p>
<p>Babak Salimi, Luke Rodriguez, Bill Howe, Dan Suciu
</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
</p>
<p>Fairness is increasingly recognized as a critical component of machine
learning systems. However, it is the underlying data on which these
systems are trained that often reflect discrimination, suggesting a
database repair problem. Existing treatments of fairness rely on
statistical correlations that can be fooled by statistical anomalies,
such as Simpson's paradox. Proposals for causality-based definitions
of fairness can correctly model some of these situations, but they
require specification of the underlying causal models. In this paper,
we formalize the situation as a database repair problem, proving
sufficient conditions for fair classifiers in terms of admissible
variables as opposed to a complete causal model. We show that these
conditions correctly capture subtle fairness violations. We then use
these conditions as the basis for database repair algorithms that
provide provable fairness guarantees about classifiers trained on
their training labels. We evaluate our algorithms on real data,
demonstrating improvement over the state of the art on multiple
fairness metrics proposed in the literature while retaining high
utility.

<p><strong>A General Datalog-Based Framework for Tractable Query Answering over Ontologies</strong>
</p>
<p>Andrea Cali, Georg Gottlob, Thomas Lukasiewicz, PODS 2009.
</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
</p>
<p> Ontologies and rules play a central role in the development of the
Semantic Web. Recent research in this context focuses especially on
highly scalable formalisms for the Web of Data, which may highly
benefit from exploiting database technologies. In this paper, as a
first step towards closing the gap between the Semantic Web and
databases, we introduce a family of expressive extensions of Datalog,
called Datalog<sup>pm</sup>, as a new paradigm for query
answering over ontologies. The Datalog<sup>pm</sup> family
admits existentially quantified variables in rule heads, and has
suitable restrictions to ensure highly efficient ontology querying. We
show in particular that Datalog<sup>pm</sup> encompasses and
generalizes the tractable description logic ɛL and the <em>DL-Lite</em>
family of tractable description logics, which are the most common
tractable ontology languages in the context of the Semantic Web and
databases. We also show how stratified negation can be added to
Datalog<sup>pm</sup> while keeping ontology querying tractable. Furthermore,
the Datalog<sup>pm</sup> family is of interest in its own right, and can,
moreover, be used in various contexts such as data integration and
data exchange. It paves the way for applying results from databases to
the context of the Semantic Web.
</p>
<p><strong>Citation from the Committee:</strong>
</p>
<p>This paper introduces and studies the Datalog+/- framework for query
answering over ontologies, which subsequently became highly
influential in both the database and knowledge representation
communities. Its main contribution is an in-depth study of the data
complexity of Datalog+/-, and several extensions and restrictions
tailored to ontologies. The paper identifies a tractable family of
Datalog+/- formalisms, based on linear tuple-generating dependencies,
that generalizes description logics of the DL-Lite family. Extensions
with keys and stratified negation are also studied. Other technical
results of the paper concerning the chase have been fundamental to
further developments in the field. The paper received over 450
citations, evidencing its significant impact.

<h2 style="clear:both; padding-top:2em;">PODS Best Paper Award</h2><p><strong>Efficient Logspace Classes for Enumeration, Counting, and Uniform Generation</strong>
</p>
<p>Marcelo Arenas,Luis Alberto Croqueviell, Rajesh Jayaram, Cristian Riveros
</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
</p>
<p> In this work, we study two simple yet general complexity classes,
based on logspace Turing machines, which provide a unifying framework
for efficient query evaluation in areas like information extraction
and graph databases, among others. We investigate the complexity of
three fundamental algorithmic problems for these classes: enumeration,
counting and uniform generation of solutions, and show that they have
several desirable properties in this respect. Both complexity classes
are defined in terms of nondeterministic logspace transducers (NL
transducers). For the first class, we consider the case of unambiguous
NL transducers, and we prove constant delay enumeration, and both
counting and uniform generation of solutions in polynomial time. For
the second class, we consider unrestricted NL transducers, and we
obtain polynomial delay enumeration, approximate counting in
polynomial time, and polynomial-time randomized algorithms for uniform
generation. More specifically, we show that each problem in this
second class admits a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation
scheme (FPRAS) and a polynomial-time Las Vegas algorithm for uniform
generation. Interestingly, the key idea to prove these results is to
show that the fundamental problem #NFA admits an FPRAS, where #NFA
is the problem of counting the number of strings of length n accepted
by a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA). While this problem is
known to be #P-complete and, more precisely, SpanL-complete, it was
open whether this problem admits an FPRAS. In this work, we solve this
open problem, and obtain as a welcome corollary that every function in
SpanL admits an FPRAS.

</p>
<p>Nofar Carmeli, Markus Kröll
</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
</p>
<p> We study the enumeration complexity of Unions of Conjunctive Queries
(UCQs). We aim to identify the UCQs that are tractable in the sense
that the answer tuples can be enumerated with a linear preprocessing
phase and a constant delay between every successive tuples. It has
been established that, in the absence of self joins and under
conventional complexity assumptions, the CQs that admit such an
evaluation are precisely the free-connex ones. A union of tractable
CQs is always tractable. We generalize the notion of free-connexity
from CQs to UCQs, thus showing that some unions containing intractable
CQs are, in fact, tractable. Interestingly, some unions consisting of
only intractable CQs are tractable too. The question of a finding a
full characterization of the tractability of UCQs remains
open. Nevertheless, we prove that for several classes of queries,
free-connexity fully captures the tractable UCQs.

</p>
<p><strong>Remembering the Probabilistic Analysis of Latent Semantic Indexing</strong>
</p>
<p>Christos Papadimitriou
</p>
<p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, the possibility of algorithmic
extraction of insight from soulless data loomed potentially important
and very intriguing. I will look back at our attempt at understanding
and advancing this research program in the light of two decades of
blistering progress in spectral methods, machine learning, data
harvesting and deep nets.
</p>
<p><strong>Database Repairs and Consistent Query Answering: Origins and Further Developments</strong>
</p>
<p>Leopoldo Bertossi
</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
</p>
<p>In this talk I will review the main concepts around database repairs
and consistent query answering, with emphasis on tracing back the
origin, motivation, and early developments. I will also describe some
research directions that has spun from those main concepts and the
original line of research. I will emphasize, in particular, fruitful
and recent connections between repairs and causality in databases.
